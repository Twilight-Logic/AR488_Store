I have been unable to compile AR488_Store, I uploaded the errors I had in the Arduino IDE to the AR488_Store folder.

I added my attempt at merging my emulator code into AR488_Store-TLIST-FIND... folder, but I couldn't get it to compile either.

I uploaded a drop of my emulator code which has been added to your current AR488 in AR488-644-TLIST-FIND... folder.

I continued emulator development and have my latest version uploaded into AR488-644-TLIST-continuedDev folder

I also added a folder with the contents of the microSD card I'm testing in Tek4924sd folder
